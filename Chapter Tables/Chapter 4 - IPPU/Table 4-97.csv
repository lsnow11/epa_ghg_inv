,"a 2014 emission estimates and the uncertainty range presented in this table correspond to selected end-uses within the aerosols, foams, solvents, fire extinguishing agents, and refrigerants sectors that comprise 97 percent of total emissions, but not for other remaining categories.  Therefore, because the uncertainty associated with emissions from “other” ODS substitutes was not estimated, they were excluded in the uncertainty estimates reported in this table.",,,,,,
