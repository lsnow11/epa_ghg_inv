,a The GWP of CH4 includes the direct effects and those indirect effects due to the production of tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor.  The indirect effect due to the production of CO2 is not included.,,
,"b For a given amount of carbon dioxide emitted, some fraction of the atmospheric increase in concentration is quickly absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial vegetation, some fraction of the atmospheric increase will only slowly decrease over a number of years, and a small portion of the increase will remain for many centuries or more.
