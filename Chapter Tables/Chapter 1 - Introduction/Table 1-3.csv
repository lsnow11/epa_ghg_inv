,a The GWPs presented here are the ones most consistent with the methodology used in the AR4 report. ,,,,,,,
,"b The GWP values presented here from the AR5 report include climate-carbon feedbacks for the non-CO2 gases in order to be consistent with the approach used in calculating the CO2 lifetime. Additionally, the AR5 reported separate values for fossil versus biogenic methane in order to account for the CO2 oxidation product.",,,,,,,
,c The GWP of CH4 includes the direct effects and those indirect effects due to the production of tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor.  The indirect effect due to the production of CO2 is only included in the value from AR5 that includes climate-carbon feedbacks.,,,,,,,
