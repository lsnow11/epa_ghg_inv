,"a The atmospheric CO2 concentration is the 2015 annual average at the Mauna Loa, HI station (NOAA/ESRL 2016).",,,,,
,b The values presented are global 2014 annual average mole fractions (CDIAC 2015). ,,,,,
,c The 2011 CF4 global mean atmospheric concentration is from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (IPCC 2013).,,,,,
,"d The growth rate for atmospheric CH4 decreased from over 10 ppb/yr in the 1980s to nearly zero in the early 2000s; recently, the growth rate has been about 5 ppb/year.",,,,,
,e The rate of concentration change is the average rate of change between 2005 and 2011 (IPCC 2013). ,,,,,
,"f For a given amount of carbon dioxide emitted, some fraction of the atmospheric increase in concentration is quickly absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial vegetation, some fraction of the atmospheric increase will only slowly decrease over a number of years, and a small portion of the increase will remain for many centuries or more.",,,,,
,g This lifetime has been defined as an “adjustment time” that takes into account the indirect effect of the gas on its own residence time. ,,,,,
,"Source: Pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations, atmospheric lifetime, and rate of concentration changes for CH4, N2O, SF6, and CF4 are from IPCC (2013). The rate of concentration change for CO2 is an average of the rates from 2011 through 2015 has fluctuated between 1.7 to 3.0 ppm per year over this period (NOAA/ESRL 2016).",,,,,
