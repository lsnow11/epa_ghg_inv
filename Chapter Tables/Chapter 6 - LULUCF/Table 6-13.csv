,"a These emissions have already been accounted for in the estimates of net annual changes in C stocks, which account for the amount sequestered minus any emissions, including the assumption that combusted wood may continue to decay through time.",,,,
,"b The data for 2014 were incomplete when these estimates were summarized; therefore 2013, the most recent available estimate, is applied to 2014. ",,,,
