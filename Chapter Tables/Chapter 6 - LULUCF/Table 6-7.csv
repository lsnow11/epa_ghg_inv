,"a The abbreviations are “F” for Forest Land, “C” for Cropland, “G” for Grassland, “W” for Wetlands, “S” for Settlements, and “O” for Other Lands.  Lands remaining in the same land-use category are identified with the land-use abbreviation given twice (e.g., “FF” is Forest Land Remaining Forest Land), and land-use change categories are identified with the previous land use abbreviation followed by the new land-use abbreviation (e.g., “CF” is Cropland Converted to Forest Land).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Note: All land areas reported in this table are considered managed.  A planned improvement is underway to deal with an exception for Wetlands, which based on the definitions for the current U.S. Land Representation Assessment includes both managed and unmanaged lands.  U.S. Territories have not been classified into land uses and are not included in the U.S. Land Representation Assessment.  See the Planned Improvements section for discussion on plans to include territories in future inventories.  In addition, C stock changes are not currently estimated for the entire land base, which leads to discrepancies between the managed land area data presented here and in the subsequent sections of the Inventory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
