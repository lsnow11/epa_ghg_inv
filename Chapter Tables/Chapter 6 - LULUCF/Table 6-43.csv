,"Notes:  These numbers are based on U.S. production data in accordance with Tier 1 guidelines, which does not take into account imports, exports, and stockpiles (i.e., apparent consumption).  Off-site N2O emissions are not estimated to avoid double-counting N2O emitted from the fertilizer that the peat is mixed with prior to horticultural use (see IPCC 2006).  Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
