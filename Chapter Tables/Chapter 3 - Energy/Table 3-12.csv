,"a In 2011 FHWA changed its methods for estimating vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and related data. These methodological changes included how vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body-type to one that is based on wheelbase.  These changes were first incorporated for the 1990 through 2010 Inventory and apply to the 2007 through 2014 time period. This resulted in large changes in VMT and fuel consumption data by vehicle class, thus leading to a shift in emissions among on-road vehicle classes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle fuel consumption estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 and MF-27 (FHWA 1996 through 2015). These fuel consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2015).  TEDB data for 2014 has not been published yet, therefore 2013 data is used as a proxy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"d In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014. The current Inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (less than two percent) to the 1999 through 2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,e Updates to the distillate fuel oil heat content data from EIA for years 1993 through 2014 resulted in changes to the time series for energy consumption and emissions compared to the previous Inventory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, this table does not include CO2 emissions from U.S. Territories, since these are covered in a separate chapter of the Inventory. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
