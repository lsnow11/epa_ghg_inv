,a See Annex 3.2 for definitions of on-road vehicle types. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2015). These mileage consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2015).  TEDB data for 2014 has not been published yet, therefore 2013 data is used as a proxy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"c In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption. These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data.  EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in the current inventory and apply to the 1990 through 2014 time period. This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"d In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014. The current Inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (less than 2 percent) to the 1999 through 2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"e Rail emissions do not include emissions from electric powered locomotives. Class II and Class III diesel consumption data for 2014 is not available yet, therefore 2013 data is used as a proxy.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"f Includes equipment, such as tractors and combines, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"g Includes equipment, such as cranes, dumpers, and excavators, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"h “Other” includes snowmobiles and other recreational equipment, logging equipment, lawn and garden equipment, railroad equipment, airport equipment, commercial equipment, and industrial equipment, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road for commercial/industrial purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Notes: In 2011, FHWA changed its methods for estimating vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and related data. These methodological changes included how vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body-type to one that is based on wheelbase.  These changes were first incorporated for the 1990 through 2010 Inventory and apply to the 2007 through 2014 time period. This resulted in large changes in VMT and fuel consumption data by vehicle class, thus leading to a shift in emissions among on-road vehicle classes. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
