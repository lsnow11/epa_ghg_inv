,a   Range of emission estimates estimated by applying the 95 percent confidence intervals obtained from the Monte Carlo Simulation analysis conducted for the year 2009.,,,,,,
,"b All reported values are rounded after calculation. As a result, lower and upper bounds may not be duplicable from other rounded values as shown in Table 3?46 and Table 3?47.",,,,,,
,c An uncertainty analysis for the non-energy CO2 emissions was not performed. The relative uncertainty estimated (expressed as a percent) from the CH4 uncertainty analysis was applied to the point estimate of non-energy CO2 emissions,,,,,,
