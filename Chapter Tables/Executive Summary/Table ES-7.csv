,"a The LULUCF Sector Total is the net sum of all emissions (i.e., sources) of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere plus removals of CO2 (i.e., sinks or negative emissions) from the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Notes:  Emissions from electricity generation are allocated based on aggregate electricity consumption in each end-use sector. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate negative values or sequestration. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
