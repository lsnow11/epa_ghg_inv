"Notes: Parentheses indicate negative values (or sequestration). Table A-2 provides a complete listing of source categories by IPCC sector, along with notations on the criteria used in identifying key categories, without LULUCF sources and sinks. Similarly, Table A-3 provides a complete listing of source and sink categories by IPCC sector, along with notations on the criteria used in identifying key categories, including LULUCF sources and sinks. The notations refer specifically to the year(s) in the inventory time series (i.e., 1990 to 2014) in which each source category reached the threshold for being a key category based on either an Approach 1 or Approach 2 level assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,
