"a For the ID criteria, Q refers to “Qualitative”, L refers to a key category identified through a level assessment; T refers to a key category identified through a trend assessment and the subscripted number refers to either an Approach 1 or Approach 2 assessment (e.g., L2 designates a source is a key category for an Approach 2 level assessment).",,,,,
"b If the source is a key category for both L1 and L2 (as designated in the ID criteria column), it is a key category for both assessments in the years provided unless noted by a subscript, in which case it is a key category only for that assessment in only that year (.e.g.,19902 designates a source is a key category for the Approach 2 assessment only in 1990).",,,,,
