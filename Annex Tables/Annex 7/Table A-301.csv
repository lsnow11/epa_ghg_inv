Notes:  Total emissions (excluding emissions for which uncertainty was not quantified) is presented without LULUCF. Net emissions is presented with LULUCF.,,,,
+ Does not exceed 0.05 MMT CO2 Eq.,,,,
NE - Not Estimated,,,,
"a Emission estimates reported in this table correspond to emissions from only those source categories for which quantitative uncertainty was performed for the current Inventory. Thus the totals reported for 2013 in this table exclude approximately 5.7 MMT CO2 Eq. of emissions for which quantitative uncertainty was not assessed.  Hence, these emission estimates do not match the final total U.S. greenhouse gas emission estimates presented in this Inventory.  All uncertainty estimates correspond only to the totals reported in this table.",,,,
"b The uncertainty estimates correspond to a 95 percent confidence interval, with the lower bound corresponding to 2.5th percentile and the upper bound corresponding to 97.5th percentile.",,,,
"c This source category’s inventory estimates exclude CO2 emissions from geothermal sources, as quantitative uncertainty analysis was not performed for that sub-source category. Hence, for this source category, the emissions reported in this table do not match the emission estimates presented in the Energy chapter of the Inventory.",,,,
d Emissions from Wood Biomass and Ethanol Consumption are not included specifically in summing energy sector totals.,,,,
e Emissions from International Bunker Fuels are not included in the totals.,,,,
"f This source category’s estimate for 2013 excludes 5.3 MMT of CO2 Eq. from several very small emission sources, as uncertainty associated with those sources was not assessed. Hence, for this source category, the emissions reported in this table do not match the emission estimates presented in the Industrial Processes and Product Use chapter of the Inventory.",,,,
g Totals exclude emissions for which uncertainty was not quantified.,,,,
"h Base Year is 1990 for all sources except Substitution of Ozone Depleting Substances, for which the United States has chosen 1995.",,,,
"i LULUCF emissions include the CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions reported for Non-CO2 Emissions from Forest Fires, N2O Fluxes from Forest Soils, CO2 Emissions from Agricultural Liming, CO2 Emissions from Urea Fertilization, Peatlands Remaining Peatlands, and N2O Fluxes from Settlement Soils.",,,,
"j Net CO2 flux is the net C stock change from the following categories: Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, Land Converted to Forest Land, Cropland Remaining Cropland, Land Converted to Cropland, Grassland Remaining Grassland, Land Converted to Grassland, Settlements Remaining Settlements, and Other. ",,,,
"k The LULUCF Sector Total is the net sum of all emissions (i.e., sources) of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere plus removals of CO2 (i.e., sinks or negative emissions) from the atmosphere.",,,,
Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate net sequestration.,,,,
