"[a] Calculation of the carbon content coefficient for motor gasoline in 2008 uses separate higher heating values for conventional and reformulated gasoline of 5.253 and 5.150, respectively (EIA 2008a). Densities and carbon shares (percent carbon) are annually variable and separated by both fuel formulation and grade, see Motor Gasoline and Blending Components, below, for details. ",,,,
"[b] LPG is a blend of multiple paraffinic hydrocarbons: ethane, propane, isobutane, and normal butane, each with their own heat content, density and C content, see Table A-51.",,,,
a Petrochemical feedstocks have been split into naphthas and other oils for this Inventory report.  Parameters presented are for naphthas with a boiling temperature less than 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Other oils are petrochemical feedstocks with higher boiling points. They are assumed to have the same characteristics as distillate fuel oil no. 2.,,,,
