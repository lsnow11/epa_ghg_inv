"a LPG is a blend of multiple paraffinic hydrocarbons: ethane, propane, isobutane, and normal butane, each with their own heat content, density and C content, see Table A-51. ",,,,
"b Heat, density, and percent carbon values are provided separately for ethane, propane and isobutene. ",,,,
c Parameters presented are for naphthas with a boiling temperature less than 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Petrochemical feedstocks with higher boiling points are assumed to have the same characteristics as distillate fuel.,,,,
