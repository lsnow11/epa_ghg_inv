a Flare gas is not used in the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion calculations and is presented for informational purposes only.,
"b Distillate fuel oil No.2 and residual fuel oil No. 6 are used in the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion calculations, and other oil types are presented for informational purposes only. An additional discussion on the derivation of these carbon content coefficients is presented in Annex 2.2.",
Sources: C coefficients from EIA (2009b) and EPA (2010a). ,
[c] These coefficients vary annually due to fluctuations in fuel quality (see Table A-39).,
