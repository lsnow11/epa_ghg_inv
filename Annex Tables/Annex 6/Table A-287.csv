"a The GWP values presented here are the ones most consistent with the methodology used in the AR4 report, and exclude climate-carbon feedbacks. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"b The GWP values presented here from the AR5 report include climate-carbon feedbacks for the non-CO2 gases in order to be consistent with the approach used in calculating the CO2 lifetime. Additionally, the AR5 reported separate values for fossil versus biogenic methane in order to account for the CO2 oxidation product.",,,,,,,,,,,
