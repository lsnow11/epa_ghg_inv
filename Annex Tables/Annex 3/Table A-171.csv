"a CFC Mix consists of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-114 and represents the weighted average of several CFCs consumed for essential use in MDIs from 1993 to 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,
"b Consumer Aerosols transitioned away from ODS prior to 1985, the year in which the Vintaging Model begins.  The portion of the market that is now using HFC propellants is modeled.",,,,,,,,,,,
