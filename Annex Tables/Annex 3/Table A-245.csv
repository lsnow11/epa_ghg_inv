"b Assimilative Capacity is the national average amount of manure-derived N that can be applied on cropland without buildup of nutrients in the soil (Kellogg et al., 2000).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Area covered by sewage sludge N available for application to soils is the available N applied at the assimilative capacity rate.  The 1992 assimilative capacity rate was applied to   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1990 – 1992 and the 1997 rate was applied to 1993-2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d Annual rate of C storage based on national average increase in C storage for grazing lands that is attributed to organic matter amendments (0.38 Mg/ha-yr) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e Contribution to Soil C is estimated as the product of the area covered by the available sewage sludge N and the average annual C storage attributed to an organic matter amendment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" f Some small, undetermined fraction of this applied N is probably not applied to agricultural soils, but instead is applied to forests, home gardens, and other lands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
