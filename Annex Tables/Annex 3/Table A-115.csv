"d In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption. These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data.  EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s inventory and apply to the 1990-2014 time period. This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"j Other emissions from electricity generation are a result of waste incineration (as the majority of municipal solid waste is combusted in “trash-to-steam” electricity generation plants), electrical transmission and distribution, and a portion of Other Process Uses of Carbonates (from pollution control equipment installed in electricity generation plants).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Notes: Increases to CH4 and N2O emissions from mobile combustion relative to previous Inventories are largely due to updates made to the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES2014a) model that is used to estimate on-road gasoline vehicle distribution and mileage across the time series. See Section 3.1 “CH4 and N2O from Mobile Combustion” for more detail. In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014a. This year’s inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (<2%) to the 1999-2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations.
