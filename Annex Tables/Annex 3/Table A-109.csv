"d Emissions of CH4 from jet fuels have been zeroed out across the time series.  Recent research indicates that modern aircraft jet engines are typically net consumers of methane (Santoni et al. 2011).  Methane is emitted at low power and idle operation, but at higher power modes aircraft engines consumer methane.  Over the range of engine operating modes, aircraft engines are net consumers of methane on average.  Based on this data, methane emissions factors for jet aircraft were changed to zero in this year’s Inventory to reflect the latest emissions testing data.  ",,
