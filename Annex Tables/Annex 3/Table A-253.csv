"Note: Parentheses indicate net C accumulation.  Estimates do not include soil C stock change associated with federal croplands and grasslands, CRP enrollment after 2010, or sewage sludge application to soils, which were only estimated at the national scale. The sum of state results will not match the national results because state results are generated in a separate programming package, the sewage sludge and CRP enrollment after 2010 are not included, and differences arise due to rounding of values in this table.",,,
