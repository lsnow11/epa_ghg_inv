IE - Included Elsewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a CO emissions from alternative fuel on-road vehicles are included under gasoline and diesel on-road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Aircraft estimates include only emissions related to LTO cycles, and therefore do not include cruise altitude emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Includes equipment, such as tractors and combines, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Includes equipment, such as cranes, dumpers, and excavators, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e “Other"" includes snowmobiles and other recreational equipment, logging equipment, lawn and garden equipment, railroad equipment, airport equipment, commercial equipment, and industrial equipment, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road for commercial/industrial purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes: The source of this data is the National Emissions Inventory. Updates to estimates from MOVES2014a is a change that affects the emissions time series. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
