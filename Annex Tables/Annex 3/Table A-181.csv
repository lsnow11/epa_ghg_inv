"Note: The cohort starting at age 0 months on January 1 is tracked in order to illustrate how a single cohort moves through the transition matrix.  Each month, the cohort reflects the decreases in population due to the estimated 0.35 percent annual death loss, and between months 4 and 5, a more significant loss is seen than in other months due to estimated veal slaughter.",,,,,,,,,,,,
