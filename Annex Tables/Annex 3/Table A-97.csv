"Note: In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption.   These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data.  EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s inventory and apply to the 1990-2014 time period.  This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes. ",,,
