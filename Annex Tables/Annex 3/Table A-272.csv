"a This estimate represents the waste that has been in place for 30 years or less, which contributes about 90 percent of the CH4 generation. Values are based on EPA (1993) for years 1940 to years 1988 (not presented in table), BioCycle 2010 and Shin 2014 for years 1989 to 2014 (years prior to 1990 and 1991 to 2004 are not presented in table).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Source: Data for years 1990 through 2014 are from the GHGRP for MSW landfills EPA (GHGRP) 2015, EPA (LMOP) 2015, and state agencies (EPA 2015c).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c This estimate represents the cumulative amount of waste that has been placed in landfills since 1940 to the year indicated and is the sum of the annual disposal rates used in the first order decay model. Values are based on EPA 1993, BioCycle 2010 and Shin 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
