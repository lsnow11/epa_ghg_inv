a The current Inventory includes updated vehicle population data based on the MOVES 2014a Model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b  Pipelines reflect CO2 emissions from natural gas powered pipelines transporting natural gas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note: Data from DOE (1993 through 2015) were used to disaggregate emissions from rail and buses.  Emissions from HFCs have been included in these estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014a. This year’s inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (<2 percent) to the 1999 to 2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations.     ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption. These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data.  EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s inventory and apply to the 1990 to 2014 time period. This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
