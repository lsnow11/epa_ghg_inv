"a In general, total emissions from foam end-uses are assumed to be 100 percent, although work is underway to investigate that assumption.  In the XPS Sheet/Insulation Board end-use, the source of emission rates and lifetimes did not yield 100 percent emission; it is unclear at this time whether that was intentional.  In the Rigid PU Appliance Foam end-use, the source of emission rates and lifetimes did not yield 100 percent emission; the remainder is anticipated to be emitted at a rate of 2.0%/year post-disposal for the next 26 years.",,,,,
