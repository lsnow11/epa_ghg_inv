aThe current Inventory includes updated vehicle population data based on the MOVES 2014a Model.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notes: Data from DOE (1993 through 2015) were used to disaggregate emissions from rail and buses.  Emissions from HFCs have been included in these estimates. Updates to the distillate fuel oil heat content data from EIA for years 1993 through present resulted in changes to the time series for energy consumption and emissions compared to the previous Inventory. In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014a. This year’s inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (<2%) to the 1999-2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations. In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption. These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data.  EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s inventory and apply to the 1990-2014 time period. This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
