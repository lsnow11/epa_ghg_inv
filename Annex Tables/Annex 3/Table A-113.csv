"Note: In 2015, EPA incorporated the NONROAD2008 model into MOVES2014a. This year’s inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014a for years 1999 through 2014.  This update resulted in small changes (<2%) to the 1999-2013 time series for NONROAD fuel consumption due to differences in the gasoline and diesel default fuel densities used within the model iterations.
