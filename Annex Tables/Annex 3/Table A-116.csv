 - Unreported or zero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NA - Not applicable, as there were no HFC emissions allocated to the transport sector in 1990, and thus a growth rate cannot be calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a Total excludes other emissions from electricity generation and CH4 and N2O emissions from electric rail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note: The current Inventory includes updated vehicle population data based on the MOVES 2014a Model.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2015). These mileage consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2015).  TEDB data for 2014 has not been published yet, therefore 2013 data is used as a proxy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
